      <h1>Palfinder Galaxy Service: Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <h2>Use of this service</h2>
      <p>The Palfinder Galaxy Service is a free, public, Internet accessible
	resource provided by the University of Manchester. By registering
	with and accessing this service you agree to be bound by the terms
	and conditions described in this document.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to revoke access to the service at any time for
	reasons deemed necessary by us.</p>
      <p>Data transfer and data storage are not encrypted. It is your
	responsibility to ensure that you observe any restrictions placed
	on the movement, storage and use of data that you upload to this
	service.</p>
      <h2>Accounts and Service Limitations</h2>
      <p>You must register an account with this service in order to use it
	by providing a valid email address.</p>
      <p>By registering with and accessing this service you consent to us
	storing your email address and other details that you provide to
	us (specifically user name and password).</p>
      <p>Accounts must be activated using the link that the service sends
	to your provided email address. Accounts which have not been
	activated within a reasonable time period may be removed and all
	associated data (including personal data) deleted.</p>
      <h2>Privacy and data protection</h2>
      <p>When you register for this service we ask you to provide a valid
	email address, and to provide password and a user name for the
	service.</p>
      <p>Your email address is used solely to provide the service to you,
	specifically to allow you to persistently store	data on the service
	and perform computations on those data, and for user-requested
	notifications such as password resets. It is only accessible to
	administrators of the service and is not shared with anyone else.</p>
      <p>The user name you choose may become visible to other users of the
        service for example if you choose to use Galaxy's "share" or
	"publish" options. You are free to choose any user name that isn't
        already in use on the system, and are not obliged to choose a name
	which identifies you personally	(unless you wish to do so).</p>
      <p>You are free to change your registered email address and user
	name at any time via the "User/Preferences/Manage information"
        option in Galaxy.</p>
      <p>Password information is stored in a "scrambled" form which can be
	used to verify your login, but from which it is not possible to
	derive the original password.</p>
      <p>In addition any data files you upload to the service are also
	stored, as are data produced by using the service. By default these
	data are only accessible by administrators of the service, however
	you can choose to make them more widely available to other users of
	the service by using the "share" or "publish" options. Note that
	regardless all these data are removed from the server automatically
	on a regular basis.</p>
      <h2>Deleting your data</h2>
      <p>Activated accounts remain on the service indefinitely. You can
	request removal of your account and deletion of all associated data
	(including personal data) at any time by emailing
	<a href="mailto:peter.briggs@manchester.ac.uk">peter.briggs@manchester.ac.uk</a>.</p>
      <h2>Use of cookies</h2>
      <p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters
	and numbers) that is sent by the web server to your web browser and
	is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the
	server each time the browser requests a page from the server. The
	identifier does not contain any personal data.</p>
      <p>A persistent cookie is a type of cookie which is stored by a web
	browser and which remains valid until its set expiry date, or is
	deleted by the user before the expiry date.</p>
      <p>The Palfinder server uses a persistent cookie only for the purpose
	of providing the service to you, by identifying and tracking you as
	you navigate different parts of the service and make use of its
	functionality, and to identify you when you return to the service.</p>
      <h2>Support</h2>
      <p>Support for this service can be requested by sending an email to
	<a href="mailto:peter.briggs@manchester.ac.uk">peter.briggs@manchester.ac.uk</a>,
	Help is provided on a "reasonable effort" basis and no guarantees
	are given for the extent of support that may be provided in
	response to such requests.</p>
      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>This service is provided to you on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT
	WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
	the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for
	a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE
	SERVICE IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an
	essential part of this service agreement.</p>
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort
	(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall The University
	of Manchester or any other entity which provides resources for this
	Service be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or
	consequential damages of any character arising as a result of the use
	of this Service including, without limitation, damages for loss of
	goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
	and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
	liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits
	such limitation.</p>
