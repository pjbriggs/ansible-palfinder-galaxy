        <h2>[13/03/2024] Centaurus updated to Galaxy version 21.05 and moved to new host VM</h2>
        <p><b>The Centaurus Galaxy service has been upgraded to Galaxy
	    version 21.05 and moved to a new host virtual machine (VM)
	    running Ubuntu Linux.</b></p>
        <p>Full details of changes in release 21.05 of Galaxy can be found
	  in the official announcement from the Galaxy Project for this
	  version:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_21.05/releases/21.05_announce_user.html">Galaxy 21.05</a></li>
        </ul>
	<p>The VM update was required as the previous operating system
	  was no longer supported and was not up-to-date with security
	  patches.</p>
	<p>If you encounter any problems with the service following the
	  updates then please contact me via
	  <a href="mailto:peter.briggs@manchester.ac.uk">peter.briggs@manchester.ac.uk</a>.
          Where appropriate it is also helpful if you can share the history
	  containing the problem with me within Galaxy.</p>
