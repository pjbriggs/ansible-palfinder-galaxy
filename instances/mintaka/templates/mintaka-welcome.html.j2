      <h2>About this service</h2>
      <p>"Mintaka" is a customised and pre-configured Galaxy instance
	providing access to tools for ChIP-seq and motif discovery, which
	have been developed by the Bioinformatics Core Facility (BCF)
	within the Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health (FBMH) at
	the University of Manchester.</p>
      <p>The service is free to use, although it requires that you first
	register and create an account in order to do so. By registering
	and using this service you agree to be bound by its
	<a href="terms.html">terms and conditions</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Mintaka is running Galaxy version '{{ galaxy_version }}'</p>

      <h2>What you can do</h2>
	<p>The Mintaka Galaxy service provides a set of novel tools to
	  assist with ChIP-seq analysis and motif discovery which are
	  otherwise not accessible in other public Galaxy instances.
	  Rather than offering a complete set of tools for performing
	  a full ChIP-seq analysis, Mintaka is intended to be used in
	  conjunction with other more general Galaxy services (for
	  example <a href="https://usegalaxy.org/">usegalaxy.org</a>).</p>
	<p>It is expected that you would already have mapped reads
	  (preferably in the BAM format i.e. the compressed and indexed
	  version of the SAM file output by most read aligners), either
	  from another Galaxy service or some other source. Once these
	  have been uploaded to Mintaka, a suggested workflow could
	  consist of:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Quality assessment of mapped reads</b> using FastQC</li>
	  <li><b>Peak calling</b> using MACS2</li>
	  <li><b>Filtering of binding regions</b> by 'fold enrichment'
	    using Galaxy tools for operating on genomic intervals</li>
	  <li><b>Identifying the closest genes to each binding region</b>
	    using RnaChipintegrator</li>
	  <li><b>Finding the relative location of binding region summits
	      to genes</b> using CEAS</li>
	  <li><b>Fetching the sequence for binding region summits</b></li>
	  <li><b>Performing motif discovery</b> using Weeder2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The ChIP-seq pipeline using these tools has been described on our
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ManchesterBCF/videos">YouTube channel</a>:</p>

      <p>The full set of videos can be viewed via the playlist
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLwM58CflFb-8YrwzXIpJIWRJiX6izIEX" >ChIP-seq analysis using Galaxy</a> (opens in a
	new window).</p>

      <h2>Uploading data</h2>
      <p>Data files can be uploaded directly to the service via a web
	browser. In principle this should work for any size of file.</p>
      <p>Alternatively files can be uploaded via an FTP server at
	ftp://mintaka.ls.manchester.ac.uk (uploaded files will then
	be available for import via the Upload tool).</p>

      <h2>Quotas and data removal</h2>
      <p>User accounts on this service have a quota of limit of
	<b>{{ default_quota_gb }} GB per user</b>. You are advised to run
	fastQC and MACS, and then delete the input BAM files.</p>
      <p>As space on our servers is limited, this service also operates
	an automatic data deletion policy: any data uploaded or generated
	are automatically deleted after	<b>{{ delete_datasets_after }}</b>.
	Please ensure that you download all outputs that you wish to keep</p>

      <h2>Acknowledging use of the service</h2>
      <p>The Mintaka Galaxy service is run by the Bioinformatics Core
	Facility (BCF) within the Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health
	(FBMH) at the University of Manchester, with support from the
	University's Research IT Services team.</p>
      <p>Details of how to acknowledge use of the service can be found on
	the <a href="citations.html">citations page</a>.</p>
