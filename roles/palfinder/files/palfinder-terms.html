      <ol>
	<li><p><b>Use of Service</b> The Palfinder Galaxy Service is a free,
	    public, Internet accessible resource (the "Service"). Data
	    transfer and data storage are not encrypted. If there are
	    restrictions on the way your research data can be stored and used,
	    please consult your local institutional review board or the
	    project principal investigator before uploading it to any public
	    site, including this Service. If you have protected data,
	    large data storage requirements, or short deadlines you
	    are encouraged to set up your own local Galaxy instance and not
	    use this Service. Your access to the service may be revoked at
	    any time for reasons deemed necessary by the operators of the
	    Service.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Accounts and Service Limitations</b> You must register an
	    account with the Service. Your registration data is primarily
	    used so you may persistently store data on the Service and use
	    advanced Galaxy features such as sharing and workflows. The
	    operators of the Service will not provide your registration data
	    to any third party unless required to do so by law. Your access
	    to the Service is provided under the condition that you abide by
	    any published quotas on data storage, job submissions, or any
	    other limitations placed on the public Service. Attempts to
	    subvert these limits by creating multiple accounts or through any
	    other method may result in termination of all associated
	    accounts.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Disclaimer</b> The Service is provided to you on an "AS IS"
	    BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including,
	    without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement,
	    merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE
	    RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER
	    OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this service
	    agreement.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Limitation of Liability</b> Under no circumstances and under
	    no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
	    or otherwise, shall The University of Manchester or any other
	    entity which provides resources for the Service be liable to
	    anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
	    damages of any character arising as a result of the use of this
	    Service including, without limitation, damages for loss of
	    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
	    and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
	    liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits
	    such limitation.</p></li>
